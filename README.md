# Ognib

Playing Bingo on a 5x5 card up to Full House often comes down to the last few balls. 

Ognib is just a game of bingo played backwards to save time. Numbers are drawn and the game is over for a player when their card has a number that is called. The last player standing wins.

## Results

A million games. Full House in Bingo is the same as a player being out in Ognib.
