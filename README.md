# ognib

Playing bingo on a 5x5 card up to Full House often comes down to the last few balls. Rather than calculating the expected number of balls, run a few lines 
of code to simulate a millon games.

Ognib is just a game of bingo played backwards to save time. Numbers are drawn and the game is over for a player when their card has a number that is called. The last player standing wins.

## Results

A million games. Full House in Bingo is the same as a player being out in Ognib.
